This repository offers a catkin wrapper for [vfc](https://sourcecode.socialcoding.bosch.com/projects/VFC/repos/vfc/browse) package.
Unfortunately many Projects at Bosch use forks of the official vfc repository and do changes on them without upstreaming. This leads to problems by sharing code between projects. This repository was created due to the need of float16_storage_t type. This type is used in [radar_gen5]( https://sourcecode.socialcoding.bosch.com/projects/RS/repos/radar_gen5/browse)  to decode data gathered from radar sensors.

There is currently a pull-request for the float16_storage_t type in the official vfc repository. As soon as it merged to master, it will be possible to use it with radar_gen5 packages.
